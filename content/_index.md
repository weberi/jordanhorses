## Mohammad Fdoul -  Horseback Riding and Desert Experiences in and near Petra 



Mohammad Fdoul offers horseback riding and desert experiences in and around Petra, one of the world's most breathtaking historical sites. Rooted in Bedouin heritage and a lifelong bond with Arabian horses, these journeys are more than just rides. They are immersive experiences that connect you with the landscape, history, and culture of southern Jordan.

In addition to helpful travel information, we'll introduce you to the heart of your experience: our horses. You'll get to know the strong, gentle animals that accompany you on your journey, as well as the passionate guides and caretakers who call this region home. Their deep connection to the land and the animals is what makes each ride truly special.


Experience Petra the way we know and love it â€” on horseback, guided by tradition and a genuine connection to the land. Whether you're riding with us for a few hours or setting out on a multi-day journey, we look forward to sharing our horses, our trails, and the desert we call home.
