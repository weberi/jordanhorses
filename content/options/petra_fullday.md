### Detailed description
We will start early at 6 AM to experience Petra all to ourselves. We'll pass through the canyon before anyone else arrives and reach the front of the Treasury just as the sun rises. After a few peaceful moments there—and some great photo opportunities—we’ll continue to the Amphitheatre, a stunning blend of Roman and Nabataean architecture, built in the first century AD.

Next, we'll visit the Royal Tombs, the Nymphaeum, the Colonnaded Street, the Byzantine Church, and the Grand Temple. Our route then takes us to Qasr al-Bint, one of Petra’s most iconic structures.

From there, we’ll leave the heart of Petra behind and follow a scenic trail eastward. Off the beaten path, we’ll visit the Pharaoh’s Columns and the Snake Monument, and explore many ancient tombs rarely seen by other visitors—all surrounded by Petra’s majestic mountains and stunning natural beauty. On the flat terrain in this area, we’ll also have the opportunity to do some trotting and galloping.

Next, we’ll ascend to the top of Mount Aaron, where breathtaking panoramic views await. From the summit, you’ll see the vast expanse of Petra’s mountains and the Wadi Araba desert stretching into the horizon.

After taking in the views, we’ll find a peaceful spot in the shade to enjoy tea, lunch, and a small camp fire. Then, we’ll make our way back through the center of Petra, passing the Royal Tombs once again, as well as the Palace Tomb and the Tomb of Sextius Florentinus—a Roman governor’s tomb dating back to 129 AD.

Finally, we’ll exit the valley of Petra from the northern side and follow a short route along the road, returning to the main gate.
