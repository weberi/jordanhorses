### Detailed Description

Your journey begins with a morning pick-up from your accommodation, followed by a scenic drive west toward the Wadi Araba desert—about 50 kilometers from Petra. Along the way, you'll witness the changing colors of the landscape, from the rose-hued mountains of Petra to the open sands of Wadi Araba.

Upon arrival at our desert base, we’ll share a traditional breakfast before setting off on the first morning ride. This two-hour ride introduces you to the landscape and your horse, with breaks along the way for tea and rest. After returning to camp, we enjoy a light lunch and prepare for the evening ride.

In the afternoon, we saddle up again and ride into the golden light of the desert. This is often the most magical part of the day. We’ll stop to take in the views and return to camp for a freshly prepared dinner around the camp fire.

This daily rhythm continues for three days, offering variety in pace, terrain, and perspective. We will adapt the  length and route of your rides to suit your wishes.


On the final morning, we enjoy a farewell ride, share one last meal together, and then return transport will take you back to your accommodation.
