This unique tour offers a fresh perspective on Petra by taking you off the main tourist trail. Instead of entering through the usual path of Al Siq, you'll begin on a scenic horseback journey through a lesser-known archaeological route.

As your guide, I’ll explain the history of the ancient city of Petra and provide maps showing many archaeological landmarks along the way.

### What Is Included

- Mineral water  
- Bedouin tea  
- Horse ride with a personal guide  
- Helmet  
- A well-trained and beautiful Arabian horse  

### Detailed Description

We begin our adventure at Petra's main gate, where you'll have your entry ticket stamped. Your horse will be ready to start your tour through rose-red Petra. Our first archeological landmark is the Tomb of the Obelisks, located about 700 meters before the Siq.

From there, we turn onto the Indiana Jones Trail  where we see the Petra Mountains full of enchanting colors. Along the way, we'll encounter caves and  Nabataean tombs until we reach the most beautiful view on our trail: the view of the Treasury from a high place on the opposite side. You’ll enjoy taking souvenir photos in the calm, serene atmosphere of the site,  then leave to have Bedouin tea at our rest point.

We continue toward Jabal al-Madhbah and see the Roman amphitheater, the Court, the Royal Tombs, the Church, the Great Temple, the Street of Columns, and Qasr al-Bint – the Palace of the Girl – all from one of the most beautiful viewpoints above.

We end the horseback portion of our trail at the top of the staircase that will take you down on foot to the city center between the Treasury and the amphitheater. The choice is yours as to which direction you'd like to walk and complete the trail of this, what I hope will be, a happy and memorable visit.
