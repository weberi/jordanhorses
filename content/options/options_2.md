## Itinerary

### This is a typical itinerary for this product

#### Stop At: Al-Siq, 8FF4+5FW, Wadi Musa, Jordan

First of all, we will meet at and return to Petra visitor center. By reaching Petra main gate, our guest will ride the horses and go through the way to Al-Siq, which is a great marvelous canyon leading to the main city of old Petra. After that, the guest will be stunned by the amazing view of the great Treasury. It is the most spectacular site inside Petra. 

- **Duration:** 30 minutes

#### Stop At: Petra - Wadi Musa 77110 Jordan

Leaving the Treasury and heading to other places inside Petra. All these places will be seen while the traveler rides the horse. The travelers will see the Royal Tombs, High Place of Sacrifice:

A site built atop Jebel Madbah with drains to channel the blood of sacrificial animals. The Theatre, Colonnaded Street, Qasr Al Bint, Great Temple, Petra Church, and then continuing our way to Mount Haroun. It is difficult to reach Prophet Haroun's tomb with horses because of the hard landscape of mountains. We will return the same way until we finish at Petra visitor center at sunset.

It is an unusual and magnificent experience for our travelers. Many previous guests and travelers joined us on this tour and said it was an unforgettable journey. As we promise, our travelers will be very satisfied and happy.
