Horse riding inside Petra's structures and mountains is a splendid experience unlike any other.

Along the way, enjoy stunning views of Jordan’s mountains and the West Bank.

### Detailed Description

We begin our adventure at the Petra Visitor Center, where you must buy a ticket (50 JD). The Jordan Pass is accepted if registered at the ticket office. I will contact you via WhatsApp one day before the tour for coordination.

From the visitor center, we’ll travel through the Petra mountains to Qararah Park — a highland with panoramic views. Continuing via Dabdabah Road, we reach Petra Bubble Luxe Resort, then explore Little Petra, including caves and ancient villages. You'll gain rich insights into ancient life, and have time for meditation and photos in this peaceful, natural setting.

Our horseback journey continues through Asiq Al-Bared, a canyon leading to hidden temples and graves. We’ll rest briefly before continuing on to our main destination — the Monastery (Al Dayr).

The Monastery is a colossal rock-cut structure and the largest façade in Petra, reached via 800 steps. Over 2,000 years old, it offers stunning views of the West Bank, Wadi Araba, and surrounding mountains. This part of the tour requires about 45 minutes of walking.

We then return toward central Petra to explore other major landmarks: the Girl's Palace (Qasr al-Bint), Colonnaded Street, Royal Tombs, Byzantine Church, and finally, the grand façade of the Treasury — Petra’s most iconic monument.

This unforgettable tour ends back at our meeting point.
