What is unique about this tour is that you get to experience Petra from a different point of view, as you will be entering the ancient city via a different trail rather than using the main trail " Al Siq".


You have the ability to explore " Al Siq" on your way back, this will grant you chance to explore almost 80% of Archeological park in one day.
I have the ability to explain the history of the ancient city of Petra. and I provide a comprehensive Maps the show many Archaeological marks. 


2–3 hours
