## Get to know us!
Behind every ride is a dedicated team that brings the experience to life. From skilled guides and caretakers to the friends and family who support each journey, our team shares a deep love for horses, the desert, and the heritage of Petra. Get to know the people who will welcome you, guide you, and ride alongside you.


Our horses are at the heart of everything we do. Strong, gentle, and deeply connected to the desert, they are more than just riding companionsâ€”they are part of the family. Each one has its own character and story, and together they make every trip special.
