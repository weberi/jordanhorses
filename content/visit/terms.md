**Booking & Participation Terms**

---

### 1  Reservations & Payment  
* A **30 % non-refundable deposit** secures your place.  
* The **total balance is due 30 days** before your ride begins.  
* Your deposit confirms arrangements for both of us; it cannot be refunded.

---

### 2  Postponements  
* One written postponement request is allowed.  
* The deposit simply moves to the new date.  
* A **second postponement counts as a cancellation** (see Section 3).

---

### 3  Cancellations & Refunds  
* Cancellation must be made in writing.  
* **Deposit (30 %) is always forfeited.**  
* If you cancel / no-show within 30 days of departure, or complete only part of the ride, the full trip cost is non-refundable.  
* No refunds for lost travel time, amended itineraries after departure, or unused services.

---

### 4  Insurance & Risk Awareness  
Horseback riding carries inherent risks. Before arrival you must hold insurance covering:  

1. Accident, death, and disability  
2. Major medical and emergency evacuation  
3. Trip cancellation or interruption  
4. Loss of personal effects  

You will be asked to sign a standard liability-waiver form before riding.

---

### 5  Force Majeure  
Events beyond our control—such as war, civil unrest, extreme weather, natural disasters, or government action—may require us to alter or cancel an itinerary.  
* We will always act with your safety in mind and consult you where possible.  
* If, after due assessment, we believe the trip can proceed safely, **normal cancellation terms apply and no refund is due.**

---

### 6  Transport & Baggage  
Travel by land, sea, or air is governed by the carrier’s own conditions and international conventions; their operational decisions may cause delays or diversions beyond our control.  
* Temporary or permanent baggage loss is the carrier’s responsibility, not ours.

---

### 7  Travel Documents & Health  
You are responsible for passports, visas, permits, vaccinations, and any medical advice needed to ensure fitness to ride.

---

### 8  Special Requests  
Please let us know in writing (e.g., dietary needs) when you book. We’ll confirm if we can accommodate them.

---

### 9  Photos & Media  
Unless you tell us otherwise in writing, you grant permission to use photographs or video taken during your tour in our promotional materials.

---

### 10  Consent & Notice of Responsibility  
Payment of your deposit—or any payment toward a reservation—confirms that you:  

* accept all terms above;  
* understand the risks involved;  
* release Mohammad Fdoul Horse Riding from liability as outlined in our waiver.
