If you're planning a trip to Jordan, the Jordan Pass is one of the smartest investments you can make. 
Find out about the benefits of Jordan Pass and how to get it



The Jordan Pass is an official travel package issued by the Jordanian Ministry of Tourism, offering convenience and savings for  exploring the countryâ€™s cultural and historical sites. It grants access to over 40 major attractions, including Petra, Jerash, Wadi Rum, and many museums and castles across Jordan. 

One of its key benefits is the waiver of the tourist entry visa fee of around 40 JD (approx. $56 USD), provided you purchase the pass before arrival and stay in Jordan for at least three consecutive nights. 

There are three pass options depending on how many days you plan to spend in Petra (1, 2, or 3 days), with prices starting at around 70 JD. The pass is delivered digitally and can be printed or saved on your phone for easy use at entry points. It not only helps you save money but also streamlines your trip by eliminating the need to buy separate tickets at each site. For most tourists, especially those planning to visit Petra, the Jordan Pass quickly pays for itself and is highly recommended as part of your travel preparations.
